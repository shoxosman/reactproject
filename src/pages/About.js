            <h2>Behind every beautiful bouquet there’s a brilliant florist</h2>
            <p>
              We've been around for a while. Some years in fact! And if we've
              learned anything over the years it's that a bouquet isn't just a
              bunch of flowers. Behind every one is an emotion. A thoughtful
              message, some very best wishes, a heartfelt thank you or a
              declaration of love. It's the celebratory hug that says ‘You've
              got this', all hand-tied with love and safely delivered to their
              door.
            </p>

            <p>
              Being the carrier of your emotion is an important job. We get it.
              And we promise you we don't take it lightly. That's why we go the
              extra mile to make it special.
            </p>

            <h2>What makes Aster so special?</h2>
